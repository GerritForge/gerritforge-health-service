      "message": "I really like the RL idea! In addition, we can experiment with simple rule-based approaches. For example, one approach that jumps to mind is to use [control charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart), which simply take decisions when tracked measures cross critical thresholds. In the worst case, such a rule-based approach would serve as a baseline to which the RL could be compared.",
