Perhaps this could even be done at regular intervals (e.g., every N episodes, where N is configurable?)\n\n2. Allow sets of parameters to be swapped when the model is in:\n- Exploration/training mode (learning rate high, epsilon moderately high)\n- Evaluation/testing mode (learning rate low, epsilon low[er])",
