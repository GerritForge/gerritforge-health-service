      "message": "About formatting (and linting) - I\u0027d like to suggest the [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).\n\nThis is written in rust and is much faster than all current alternatives, making IDE plugins\u0027 usability excellent. It also works as a drop-in replacement for black.\n\nIt offers [several installation options](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) (I used `pipx` on Ubuntu).\n\nDoesn\u0027t matter for this ticket as we\u0027re only reformatting, but if we do this in CI at some point the tool itself becomes relevant.",
