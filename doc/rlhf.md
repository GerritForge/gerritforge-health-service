## Languages

There are two leading systems for developing AI Models for RLHF:

- [TensorFlow Agents](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

They are both very popular, a [comparative analysis](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/pytorch-vs-tensorflow)
shows that whilst TensorFlow has been very much used in the past and being very much
supported at runtime, PyTorch has a wider community support and libraries.

There are also more traditional approaches based on rule-based systems and fuzzylogic, which
is based on a more static definition of the rules to achieve the optimal result rather
than learning.

## Community

The AI world has a vibrant community called [HuggingFace](http://huggingface.co/) where researchers
academics and companies are sharing and exchanging experiences, models and code on reinforcement
learning and other AI techniques.

## Runtime environments

- [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server) is an Open-Source framework for
  running AI Modules on a cluster of NVidia CPUs
